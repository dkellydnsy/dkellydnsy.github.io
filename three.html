        <h1>Threes (THREE: The End)</h1>
        <p> This is the End page for my NYPL: Project Code indidual Project "Threes" Website. (Page 3 of 3)</p>
        <p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Threes are special within the fields of math (see the AMAZING: "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule">Sum of the Digits Divisibility Rule for 3</a>") & science, including many things within nature.</li>
                <br />
                <li>In measurements: There are 3 feet in a yard. There are 3 teaspoons in tablespoon, & There are 3 Miles in a League. <br />
(Funny/Weird/Interesting Fact: Many people believe leagues refer to depths of the ocean based on the naugtical term and classic books like <br />
Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea"; when infact the term "leauge" originally meant: <br />
The estimated distance a person could travel from one place to another within a period of 1 Hour is equal to 1 League.</li>
                <br />
                <li>In Math a Triangle is a linear shape that has 3 sides. In science/engineering a Triangle is considered the strongest geometric shape. <br />
In fact as long as you don't tightly pack Triangles together (to form tesseracts), then Triangles truely are the strongest shape (even alone within nature). <br />
However, if you do decide to pack multiple identical shapes tightly together the strongest shape becomes a hexagon. <br /> 
This must prove that "Bee's" are smart; because, after millions of years of eveolution: honey combs in nature are 6-side shapes (hexagons). <br />
Oh well 2x3=6, so the strongest shape in nature is double "Threes". Threes Rule! </li>
                <br />
                <li>Sir Isaac Newtons 3 Laws of Motion form the foundation of Classical Physics (Classical Mechanics). It is funny that the remaining newer interrellated <br />
				branches of physics also also bundled into 3 categories: Quantum Mechanics, Relettivistic Mechanics (Relativity), and Quantum Field Theory. </li>
            </ul>
