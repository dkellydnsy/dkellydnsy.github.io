        <h1>Rattus Maximus (Rat Lore)</h1>
        <p> Rat Lore content below contains Popular Culture, Rat Legends, and Societal Information about NYC Rats.</p>
        <p>
           <ul> 
                <li>NYC's Rat is the Norwegian Rat; but, the Norweigan Rat actually originates from the fields of Central Asia/China. </li>
                <br />
                <li>The Term: Rat Race is frequently associated with NYC's working class masses.
                <br /> Since NYC is a large city with a large congested poplulation, the term Rat Race has a generally negative connotation and is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment. <br />A rat race is considered to be an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Idiomatic Expression examples: Don't be a rat! & I don't give a rat's ass.  &  I smell a rat.: Generally negative expressions. <br /> "Don't be a rat" means don't speak or tell of something which should be implicitly or explicitly kept a secret. <br />
"I don't give a rat's ass" is a way of emphasising and referring to something which you don't really care about. <br /> Finally the term "I smell a rat" means you know somthing is wrong or out of place and possibly even sense there is a responsible guilty party to blame for whaterver is sensed as being wrong. 
               </li>
                <br />
                <li>Chinese and Indian Cultures hold the Rat in very high regard. The Hindu religion from India holds rats sacred and has temples dedicated to rats. In Hindu mythology Vahana the Rat is a companion to the very popular elephant-headed Hindu God: Ganesh. In Asian Culture the Chinese Zodiac dedicates 1 of its 12 years to the year of the Rat. Rats are looked up to as being clever, swift, and resourceful within asian cultures.
