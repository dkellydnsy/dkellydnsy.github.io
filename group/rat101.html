        <h1>Rattus Maximus (Rat 101)</h1>
        <p> Rat 101 content below contains facts/trivia about NYC Rats.</p>
        <p>
           <ul> 
                <li>The Norwegian Rat (Species: Rattus norvegicus) is the most common rat in NYC. </li>
                <br />
                <li>The NYC Brown (and Black) Rats are not considered to be indidigenous to NYC (nor North America for that matter). </li>
                <br />
                <li>NYC Rats are brown/grey rodents with a body lenght of of 10in (25cm) long with a similar length for their tails. </li>
                <br />
                <li>Males NYC Brown Rats weigh about 12oz (350g) which is about 40% heavier than female Brown Rats weigh: 9 oz (250g).</li>
                <br />
                <li>NYC's Brown Rats have excellent acute hearing and are sensitive to ultrasound.
                <br /> 
                    NYC's Brown Rats also posess a very highly developed olifactory sense (accute sense of smell).</li>
                <br />
                
                <li>The NYC Brown Rats have extremely poor vision.
        <br />Therefore Rats primarily rely on their sense of smell to navigate within their environment;
        <br /> along with utilizing their ultra-sensitivity to sounds to complement their powerful olifactory
        <br /> senses to make up for their very very poor eyesight.</li>
                <br />
                <li>NYC Brown Rats are considered to be true omnivores and will eat almost anything.
                <br />
                They are especially fond of cereals and grains. </li>
                <br />
