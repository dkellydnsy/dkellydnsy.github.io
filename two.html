        <h1>Threes (TWO: The Middle)</h1>
        <p> This is the Middle page for my NYPL: Project Code indidual Project "Threes" Website. (Page 2 of 3)</p>
        <p>
            <ul> 
                <li>There are many examples of "Threes" throughout time (human history) and space (worldwide across geographies and cultures).<br />
So many things are represented and recognized utilizing threes to convey information (and possibly to impart  wisdom, too).</li>
                <br />
                <li>I find it particularly interesting that this class project is dependent heavily on Threes (3's).
                <br />There are 3 colors in the RGB (Red-Blue-Green) Color model which forms the basis of the CSS HEX CODES used in the website. <br />The 6 Hexadecimal numbers are 3 pairs of colors representing a two digit hexadeximal value for Red 1st, then Green 2nd, & finally Blue 3rd. <br />The 1st Hex Code: #000000 represents BLACK (which is the absence/absorbtion of ALL colors)... <br /> ... and the last (final possible color) Hex Code: #FFFFFF represents White (which is the reflection of ALL colors)... </li>
                <br />
                <li>Here are some other sayings/expressions which reference or utilize "Threes": <br/>
The Right To: Life. Liberty. & The Pursuit of Happyness.<br />
The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth. <br />
Hear No Evil. See No Evil. Speak No Evil. <br />
Third time is the charm. </li>
                <br />
            </ul>
